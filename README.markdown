DbMaster is an open-source database management & querying tool.
Under heavy development, it targets SQL developers & students. It aims at providing a free (GPL) alternative to propriatary software like AnySQL.

Unlike other specific tools (pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.) it runs regardless the DBMS you're using.

See INSTALL for build instructions or ChangeLog to consult the last modifications.

As a GPL software, you are free to :

* Use it, however you want
* Copy & redistribute it, how many times you want
* Modify and fork it

With a little restriction : you cannot change the terms of the licence, neither you can include parts of DbMaster inside a propriatary software. Details are provided in the Licence file.
