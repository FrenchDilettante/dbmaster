About
=====

DbMaster is a database management and querying tool. It targets SQL developers and students. It aims at providing an alternative to software like AnySQL. Unlike other specific tools (such as pgAdmin or MySQL Workbench), it runs regardless the DBMS you're using.


DBMS compatibility
------------------

DbMaster is built over Qt, which offers a framework to connect to relationnal database systems: [QtSql](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qtsql.html).
Nokia provides the drivers for the following DBMS:

* IBM DB2
* Borland InterBase (Firebird compatible)
* MySQL
* Oracle Call Interface Driver
* Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) (generic driver)
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* Sybase Adaptive Server (obsolete)

Following DBMS have been tested and validated:

* Firebird
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* ODBC
* SQLite

Tested, but do not expect a good compatibility:

* IBM DB2
* Oracle Express

Others haven't been tested.
